      <h1>My Heart for You</h1>
      <p>
        <span class="text-block">
          I love you in ways that feel bigger than my own heart like my chest
          can barely hold everything I feel for you Samia When I think about you
          Samia I melt completely my walls fall my pride disappears and all that
          is left is this soft honest love that only you can bring out of me You
          are my home Samia not a place not a building but a feeling the feeling
          of peace when I hear your voice the feeling of safety when I am next
          to you the feeling that no matter how hard the world gets I have
          somewhere to belong and that somewhere is you
        </span>
        <span class="text-block">
          You deserve the whole world Samia you deserve love that is pure and
          patient and real you deserve someone who protects your heart who
          listens to you who stands by you and I promise I am always trying my
          best to be that man for you I care about you deeply Samia about your
          smile your mood your thoughts your dreams I care about the way your
          day went I care about what makes you happy and what makes you quiet I
          pay attention because you matter to me more than you know
        </span>
        <span class="text-block">
          You make me feel safe to be myself Samia safe to be vulnerable safe to
          dream bigger than I ever did before and somehow just by being you you
          push me to become the best version of myself not because you force me
          but because loving you makes me want to grow You changed me in the
          most beautiful way Samia you made me softer kinder more patient more
          focused on my future you made me want to build something real
          something strong something worthy of us and I am always trying my best
          for you for us for the life we talk about
        </span>
        <span class="text-block">
          I love spending our time together Samia not just the big moments but
          the simple ones the random talks the quiet sitting the way we can turn
          nothing into something special And especially when we eat together
          Samia it is never just food it feels different it tastes different
          like happiness is sitting at the table with us like every bite carries
          laughter and warmth I love looking at you while we talk I love those
          small moments because they feel like memories being created in real
          time
        </span>
        <span class="text-block">
          Even the smallest things with you stay in my heart Samia like the way
          you made me drink chocolate milk and somehow that simple thing became
          a core memory for me now every time I think about it I smile because
          it reminds me of how you make everything sweeter without even trying I
          love your gorgeous smile Samia the way it lights up my world I love
          your soft voice that calms me instantly I love the way you look at me
          like I matter like I am someone important in your life And when you
          touch me gently in your own quiet way Samia I melt all over again your
          touch feels warm safe real it reaches deep inside me and reminds me
          that this is not just a dream this is us
        </span>
        <span class="text-block">
          You touched my soul before you ever touched my hands Samia you
          understood my heart in a way no one ever has and that is why you are
          so special to me I cherish every picture with you Samia every detail
          about you the little habits the way you laugh the way you react the
          way you care about me and check on me And I want my future to be with
          you Samia I want you to be my wife the woman I wake up beside every
          single morning the first face I see the first smile that starts my day
          I want to wake up and pull you closer and kiss you softly and hold you
          tightly in my arms like I never want to let you go I want to build a
          life with you Samia share a home with you grow with you face
          everything together as one I do not just see you in my present I see
          you in my forever
        </span>
        <span class="text-block">
          You are not just someone I love Samia you are my comfort my happiness
          my motivation my peace my home And every single day I wake up choosing
          you again Samia choosing to love you better choosing to protect what
          we have choosing to grow into the man you deserve Because loving you
          Samia is not just a feeling It is my favorite thing in this world I
          LOVE YOUUUUU
