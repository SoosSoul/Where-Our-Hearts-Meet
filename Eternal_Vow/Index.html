        Samia
      </h1>

      <p>
        Where do I even begin Samia you are everything to me more than I could
        ever truly express in simple words From the moment we met my entire
        world shifted in the most beautiful way and nothing has ever felt the
        same since
      </p>

      <p>
        Your smile Samia is a piece of heaven it lights up parts of me I did not
        even know were in darkness it reaches places inside my heart that no one
        has ever touched before And your laugh that laugh is the sweetest sound
        I have ever heard when I hear it my heart loses control for a second
        like it cannot handle that much happiness at once
      </p>

      <p>
        Your voice Samia is the one sound I could listen to forever it feels
        like peace it feels like home it feels like something written just for
        my soul When you speak I feel calm I feel safe I feel chosen
      </p>

      <p>
        I adore you in ways words will never fully capture Samia You are perfect
        to me not because you are flawless but because every single part of you
        fits perfectly with my heart The way you love the way you care the way
        you laugh the way you look at me with those beautiful eyes like I matter
        like I am yours
      </p>

      <p>
        You make my heart race Samia and at the same time you make it feel
        steady You are my excitement and my peace in the same breath I feel so
        unbelievably lucky to call you mine
      </p>

      <p>
        I promise you this Samia I promise to love you with everything inside me
        I promise to stand by your side in every season whether life is soft or
        hard whether days are easy or heavy I will be there
      </p>

      <p>
        I promise to cherish you to respect you to protect your heart and to
        never take a single second with you for granted Because you are not just
        part of my life you are my heart my world my everything
      </p>

      <p>
        I want my future with you Samia I want you to be my wife the woman I
        wake up beside every morning the first face I see the first smile that
        begins my day I want to wake up and pull you close kiss you softly and
        hold you tightly in my arms like I never want to let you go
      </p>

      <p>
        I want to build a life with you Samia a real life filled with memories
        laughter growth and love I want to grow old with you still looking at
        you like you are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen
      </p>

      <p>
        You are the reason I smile every day Samia the reason I feel alive the
        reason I push myself to become better stronger more worthy of the love
        you give me
      </p>

      <p>
        I want forever with you not just days not just years but a lifetime of
        choosing each other again and again I want to make memories with you
        hold you close protect you and never let go
      </p>

      <p>
        You mean more to me than you will ever fully understand Samia and I love
        you more deeply than words could ever truly say
      </p>

      <p>Forever yours Samia always and endlessly</p>
